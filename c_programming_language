C PORGRAMMING LANGUAGE
----------------------

Four important aspects of any language are
--> the way it stores data
--> the way it operates upon this data
--> how it accomplishes input and output,
--> how it lets you control the sequence of execution of instructions in
a program.

In programming languages,
--> constants are often called literals, whereas,
--> variables are called identifiers.

understand the terms

-> literal
-> variable
-> constant
-> identifier

int name = "Muralikrishnan"

Constants in C
--------------

Primary Constants
    Integer Constant
    Real Constant
    Character Constat

Secondary Constats
    Array
    Pointer
    Structure
    Union
    Enum
    Etc



-> printf function never supplies a newline character automatically.

In C, we have the following data types:

int, float, char(character, a single byte), short, long, double

The size of these objects are machine dependent.

*** There are also arrays, structures and unions of these basic data types.
pointers to them, and functions that return them. ***

The indentation emphasizes the logical structure of the program.
Although C compilers do not care about how a program looks, proper indentation and spacing
are critical in making programs easy for people to read.

Text input or output, regardless of where it originates or where it goes to, is dealt with
as streams of characters. A text stream is a sequence of characters divided into lines; each
line consists of zero or more characters followed by a newline character.

COMPILATION -> converting source code to machine code

** The major difference between a SUBROUTINE and a FUNCTION is that,

in case of function we can return a value to the calling function when
required. but a subroutine is used to execute a set of instructions and no
value needs to be returned. **
