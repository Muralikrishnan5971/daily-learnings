Dunder Methods - (also sometimes refered as magic methods)
https://mathspp.com/blog/pydonts/dunder-methods#:~:text=What%20are%20dunder%20methods%3F,__%20or%20__add__%20.

n Python, dunder methods are methods that allow instances of a class to interact with the built-in functions and operators of the language. The word “dunder” comes from “double underscore”, because the names of dunder methods start and end with two underscores, for example __str__ or __add__.

If you have defined classes in Python, you are bound to have crossed paths with a dunder method: __init__. The dunder method __init__ is responsible for initialising your instance of the class, which is why it is in there that you usually set a bunch of attributes related to arguments the class received.

Dunder methods are not called magically, though. They are just called implicitly by the language, at specific times that are well-defined, and that depend on the dunder method in question.

All Python operators, like +, ==, and in, rely on dunder methods to implement their behaviour.
