installing Bazel

brew install bazelisk  (a wrapper around bazel)

create .bazelversion file from which bazelisk will fetch the required version of bazel.
create WORKSPACE.bazel file defines that this is a bazel project (bazel repository).
There is only one WORKSPACE file that is maintained throughout the project. Hence it is placed at the root directory of our project.
And it is used to pull things into our project. For now it can be empty.is

But now that we have these to files, we run some basic bazel commands

bazel --version
bazel build //...   ---> to build  all targets

bazel build //projects/project-java/...

bazel build //projects/...

bazel-bin
bazel-project-name
bazel-out
bazel-testlogs

the above folder are generated by bazel, and are not meant to be pushed to version controlling.
