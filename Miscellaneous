Dealership Management Software - DMS

ARC ---> we sell ARC to Dealership

Automotive Enterprise Cloud ----> end users are the Enterprises (like chevy, Bolt)

Cloud Native - Scalability, easy to enhance


In US, Dealership has far more to offer than the OEM's

Why Tekion tries to integrate with OEM's ?
We need integration with OEM for warrenty claims,
OEM had more data on the vehicles, like features, specs..., recall in car dealership

we cant sell a vehicle on recall

Data we get from a OEM is on a vehicle level.
