Components of UNIX:
 
Two components of Unix:e

1. Shell

It is the outer layer of the Unix operating system
User communicates using the shell only

Shell reads the command provided by the end user
Shell checks a whether command valid or not
Shell checks whethr the command is user properly
If everything is proper, then shell interprets (converts) the user entered command into kernel understandable form and handover that to kernel
up to this job of the shell is completed
Shell acts as interface between user and kernel

Now kernel is responsible to execute those commands and provide  the result


2. Kernel

It is the core component of the Unix operating system
Kernel is responsible to execute our commands with the help of hardware components
Memory allocation, processor allocation low level activities are carried out by Kernel
Kernel acts as a interface between shell and hardware components

**********************************************************

In Linux there are two tyoes of user

Normal user  --- displays a $ prompt
Super user or Roor user --- displays a # prompt




**************** linux commands **************************

whoami
ls        ---> list out all files and directory
ls -l	  ---> lists all files with size, (ls -l sunny.jpg) (long list)
ls -author---> lists all files with author name
ls -a     ---> lists all hiding files
file      ---> gives the file type



pwd       ---> print working directory
mkdir     ---> create a directory

With the help of mkdir -p command you can create sub-directories of a directory. It will create parent directory first, if it doesn't exist. But if it already exists, then it will not print an error message and will move further to create sub-directories.

cd        ---> change directory
touch     ---> create a empty file
rmdir     ---> remove a directory
rm        ---> remove a file (mostly should be used to remove directory also)
rm -rf    ---> to remove a directory with sub directory and files, -r is recursive, -f force 

date      ---> display current date
cal       ---> display current month calendar

chmod u+x sample.sh   -----> giving execute permission for the script (change mode)

sudo -i   ---> to switch to super user (superuser do)
tty       ---> prints the filename of the terminal (located in the root/dev/ location (teletype )
which cd  ---> displays the binary executable PATH of the given commands eg; cd


**********************************************************

Linux file system

In python everything is treated as a Obejct.
Similarly, In linux everything is treated as a file, even device and directories are treated as files.

In linux, file extension is not important. Based on our content linux can identify the file type.

All files in the Linux are divided into three types.

1. Normal or Ordinary files
2. Directory files
3. Device files

Normal Files
------------
These file contains data. 
These files can be normal text files or binary files (image, audio, video files)

adb.txt
script.sh
test.py
image.jpg
flyingmonkey.mp4

Directory Files
---------------
These files represent directories
As we use folder terminology, in Linux we use Directory terminlology.
Directories contains files and sub directories 

Linux identifies the file type by the data present in the file.
If a empty file is present, linux can identify the type.

** Example, if we create .jpg file and write text data into it, 
linux will identify it as a text file and not a image file **

Device Files
------------
In Linux, every device is represented as a file.
Devces like Keyboard, terminal etc.
Using this file we can communicate with that device
these file are present in the root/dev directory.

Example, Terminal is also a device treated as file.

tty ---> The tty command of terminal basically prints the file name of the terminal connected to standard input
example: /dev/ttys000

echo i luv monke > /dev/ttys001       ---> communicating from one terminal to another

blue color represents directories,


ls -l command list all files and directories
starting with '-' ---> normal files
starting with 'd' ---> directory files

ext3, ext4, xfs --> linux file system

cd / --> enters the root directory


******************************************************************

File System Navigation

For every user a seperate directory will be created, that is called User home directory.  

/    ---> root directory

Inside root directory, there  are multiple sub diorectories, eg: bin, etc, opt, dev, User...

There are some hidden files and directories.

ls           ---> won't display hidden files.
ls -a	     ---> displays ALL (hidden) files and directories

Every directory contain two hidden files.

First hidden file is '.'    ---> represents current directory

Second hidden file is '..'  ---> represents parent directory

cd .         ---> change directory to CURRENT directory (we will be in the same directory) (useless command)
cd ..        ---> change directory to PARENT directory

cd ~         ---> change directory to USER HOME directory
cd           ---> Also changes directory to USER HOME directory
cd -         ---> change directory to PREVIOUS directory

******************************************************************

Linux file system hierarchy

Linux file system has TREE like structure

It starts with root (/)
/ is the TOP most directory, it can contain multiple sub directories.

Sub Directories:
----------------

bin      ---> contains all (Binaries Executables) related to linux commands (like touch, cd, mv, cat etc.,)
              all commands available for NORMAL USER is present in bin directory

in latest linux version, /usr/bin also contains the binary executables

Using Shell scripting we can create owr own commands (Binary Executables)

sbin     ---> System Binaries
			  commands to do high level activities disk partition, networking management used by SUPER USER

etc      ---> This directory contains all system configuration files (etc - eccetra)
			  Example username, password details etc
			  These configuration files are used by the operating system itself.

			  etc/passwd    ---> all USER information is stored in passwd file.
			  etc/group     ---> all groups user is part of, details is stored in group file
			  etc/hosts     ---> all host information is stored in hosts file (ip addresses and dns names)

*******************************************************************

ls                      ---> lists all files and directory in Alphabetical order
ls -r					---> lists all files and directory in REVERSE Alphabetical order
ls -l  					---> lists all files and directory in LONG LISTING format

-rw-r--r--  1 fmganesa  staff     52 Jan 24 21:29 count.txt

 '-'      				---> first character represents the type of file 
 'rw-r--r--'            ---> remaining nine characters represents permissions
 '1'                    ---> 1 represents the No of linked files
 'fmganesa'				---> user/owner
 'staff'				---> group the user belong to 
 '52'					---> size of the file
 'Jan 24 21:29'			---> created time or last modified time
 'count.txt'			---> name of the file

 ls -a 					---> lists ALL hidden files and directories
 ls -A                  ---> lists ALL files except . and .. files
 ls -F                  ---> lists all the files by TYPE

 /                      ---> directory
 *						---> executable file
 @						---> linked file


man ls       			---> Opens manual page (documentation) for the ls command
man ls > ls_docu.text	---> 

wc -l ls_docu.txt       ---> prints the number of lines in th file

ls | wc -l              ---> prints number of files
ls -a | wc -l           ---> prints number of ALL hidden files

ls -i                   ---> displays the all files and directory with inode (index node)

For every file all attributes will be stored in a memory location. This location is called inode.
The File attributes include size of the file, no of links to file, owner name, created time, last modified time.

By default 'ls' does not display sub directory contents

ls -R                   ---> displays all files and also Sub directory files (Recursive )
ls -s                   ---> displays all files and directories with block size
ls -ls
ls -lt                  ---> displays all files and directories in the order of LAST MODIFIED

8 -rw-r--r--  1 fmganesa  staff     52 Jan 24 21:29 count.txt

1 block = 1kb           ---> it varies based on the linux flavor

ls -lh                  ---> displays size in human readable form

-rw-r--r--  1 fmganesa  staff    52B Jan 24 21:29 count.txt

ls -l | head            ---> In the full list of output lines, display only the FIRST 10 lines.

ls -l | head -3         ---> In the full list of output lines, display only the FIRST 3 lines.

ls -l | tail            ---> In the full list of output lines, display only the LAST 10 lines.

ls -l | tail -3         ---> In the full list of output lines, display only the LAST 3 lines.

ls -l | more            ---> display list in page by page, Only forward direction only
ls -l | less            ---> display list in page by page, BOTH direction only (more powerful)

ls -ai
ls -ia                  ---> both same, order does'nt matter


*******************************************************************

Command Line Arguments
----------------------

eg: ./test.sh 10 29 30

here, 10, 29, 30 are command line arguments

$#   ---> No of arguments (here it is 3 (10, 20, 30))
$0   ---> Script name (test.sh)
$1   ---> First argument (10)
$2   ---> First argument (20)
$3   ---> First argument (30)

$*   ---> All arguments (10 20 30)
$@   ---> All arguments (10 20 30)

$?   ---> Represents exit code of previously executed command or script

Difference between $@ and $*
----------------------------

$@   ---> All command line arguments with space seperator
          "$1" "$2" "$3" "$4"

$*   ---> All command line as a single string
          "$1c$2c$3c$4" where c is the first chracter of the IFS (Internal Field Seperator)
          The deault is space.

The shell has one environment variable, which is called the Internal Field Separator (IFS). This variable indicates how the words are separated on the command line. The IFS variable is, normally or by default, a white space (' '). 

set  ---> display all pre defined environment variables  
env  ---> display all pre defined environment variables

set | grep IFS

IFS=$' \t\n\C-@'

What is the main purpose of cmmand line arguments?
To customize behaviour of the script

echo murali |wc -c    ---> displays the character count
7
it includes an /n new line character at the end, hence the count is 7.

echo -n MURALI |wc -c
6
it ignores the new line character, hence the count is 6.


len=$(echo $1 |wc -c)
echo "The lenght of given string $1:$len"


********************************************************************

Write a script to create log file with time stamp

echo "hello" > demo.text     ---> overwrites the file with "hello"

echo "hello" >> demo.text    ---> appdends the file content with "hello"



Miscellaneous commands

ps ---> process status command
id ---> tells all about us
hostname ---> 
uname
uname -r
uname -a
wgo ---> tells who else logged in
caffinate --> keeps the system awake till the terminal is running

To lock screen from Termianl
pmset displaysleepnow  --> puts the screen to sleep and eventually, system is locked.

********************************************************************

Linux File Ownership
--------------------

In Linux, there are three types of owners: user, group, and others.

Linux User: A user is the default owner and creator of the file. So this user is called owner as well.

Linux Group: A user-group is a collection of users. Users that belonging to a group will have the same Linux group permissions to access a file/ folder. You can use groups to assign permissions in a bulk instead of assigning them individually. A user can belong to more than one group as well

Other: Any users that are not part of the user or group classes belong to this class.

File permissions fall in three categories: read, write, and execute

Below is the symbolic representation of permissions to user, group, and others.

    -        rwx   rwx    rwx
filetype    user  group  other

Example: ls -l

-rw-r--r--@ 1 muralikrishnan  staff  99 Jun 13 11:42 test.py


So for the test.py file,

rw- is the user permissions
r-- is the group permissions
r-- is the other permissions
muralikrishnan is the user
staff is the group
99 is size

And the "-" in the beginning represents file or directory.

- means a regular file
d means a directory

Now modifying permissions using chmod command:

syntax of chmod:

chmod permissions filename

We can change permissions using two modes:

1. Symbolic mode:
u - user   
g - group
o - other

r - read
w - write
x - execute

2. Absolute mode: represents permissions as 3-digit octal numbers ranging from 0-7.



^^^^^^
echo $0 --> will display the name of the currently running file

The $0 is one of the special variables you get in bash and is used to print the filename of the script that is currently being executed.

^^^^^^

*******************************************************

awk command (more of a scripting language) stands for Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan, initials for its designers

by default the awk command see spaces as delimiter fir each field

awk '{command}' filename

awk '{print}' tmnt.txt  --> prints all content
awk '{print $0}' tmnt.txt  --> prints all content

awk '{print $1}' tmnt.txt  --> prints all the first field in all lines
awk '{print $2}' tmnt.txt  --> prints all the second field in all lines
awk '{print $3, $1}' tmnt.txt  --> prints all the third and first field in all lines

similarly we can pip commands to awk as well

ls -l | awk '{print $1}'   ---> prints all the first field from the listed files

echo the monkey is flying high | awk '{print $2}'   ---> this prints the second field in the out put of the first command, that is monkey

we can specify the delimiting charater from default value space to any thing by below command,
here the delimiting character in :

awk -F':' '{print $3}' /etc/passwd   

*********************************************************

pbcopy --> copies content to clipboard --> paste board copy
pbpaste --> pastes content from the clipboard --> paste board paste



If directory name is a single word, cd my_directory will work.
In case, our directory name has two words like 'My Directory',
Then we should use cd command as cd "My Directory"

readlink -f settings.txt      ----> prints the ABSOLUTE FILE PATH of the specified file

unzip filename.zip -d /destination/folder_path

*******************************************************

The watch command is a utility from the procps-ng package.
This package is by default available on all Linux distros.
We can use the watch command to execute a command at regular intervals. 
It displays its output on a console or terminal in fullscreen mode.

watch -n 1 -d find .

-n --> specifies the intraval
-d --> differance
followed by the command we need to execute for the mentioned interval

********************************************************\\

$ find ~/Downloads -type f -size 35000k -exec rm -i {} \;

Here are some one-liners to help you if you want to delete files blindly:

$ find ~/Downloads -type f -size 35000k -exec ls -l {} \; | awk '{ print $9 }' | xargs rm

$ find ~/Downloads -type f -size +35000k -delete

********************************************************

The name "tarball" is derived from the combination of "tar" (short for "tape archive"), which is the archiving utility used to bundle the files, and "ball," which describes the concept of packing multiple files together.

Tarballs are widely used in Unix-like systems, including Linux and macOS, as a common way to distribute and transport files or software packages. They are popular for creating backups, distributing source code, and packaging software for installation. Tarballs are especially useful when preserving the file structure and permissions of the files is important.

To create a tarball, the "tar" command is used with specific options to bundle the files and directories. For example, to create a tarball named "myfiles.tar.gz" from a directory called "myfiles," you would use the following command:

tar -czvf myfiles.tar.gz myfiles

Here:

-c: Create a new archive.
-z: Compress the archive using gzip.
-v: Verbose mode, display the progress and file details during the archiving process.
-f: Specify the output filename.

To extract the contents of a tarball, you would use a similar command:

tar -xzvf myfiles.tar.gz

-x: Extract`

********************************************************

mv -> You can only move files to a directory that already exists: Linux will not create a new directory with the mv command.

*********************************************************

SYMBOLS

`  --> backtick
^  --> carrot or cap symbol --> indicates something that starts with.

example:
ls | grep ^D   --> It will list all files with filenames starting with D

() --> open and close parentheses
{} --> open and close curly braces
[] --> open and close brackets
| --> pipe
\ --> backslash -- used in windows to mention the file path

<,> --> input and output
>> --> means appending to the file
> --> means overwriting the file
< --> sending output as input
/ --? forwardslash -- used in linux to mention the file path

grep comamnd

ed is an oldest line based bulit-in editor that comes with unix based systems.
quit and ed editor using ctrl+D
the ed commands g/re/p command constitute to the linux grep command, which stands for 
grep --> global/regular expression search/print
In ed, the command g/re/p would print all lines featuring a specified pattern match

grep -o name  --> will list only exactly matching text
grep name     --> will list the entire line matching text

pgrep command  ---> process command

The Process Grep, commonly known as pgrep, is another popular method used for finding process IDs.
The pgrep command displays the PID of processes that match any given pattern, similar to how grep is used to match patterns in a text file.
You can use pgrep to help you identify a process based on multiple factors when you don’t know its exact PID.

pgrep [options] {pattern}

ps --> process status

ps command is used to list the currently running processes and their PIDs along with some other information depends on different options

ps ---> shows all running process in the current shell

To view all running process
ps -A
ps -e

ps -Aj
ps -ej ---> To display more information on the process

ps aux

top command

The top command is another highly recommended method to see your Linux servers resource usage. 
One can see a list of top process that using the most memory or CPU or disk.



Unix utilities
==============

Shell redirection commands
--------------------------

cmd < file 			# takes input from a file
cmd > file 			# stores output to a file (truncates)
cmd >> file 		# appends output to a file
cmd_1 | cmd_2		# pass output of command 1 as input for command 2

cat
cat -n
tac    (tail -r path/to/file)
head 
head -n 25 path/to/file    ---> prints first 25 lines from the file
tail
tail -n 25 path/to/file    ---> prints last 25 lines from the file
tail -f path to file       ---> follows

tr command

Translate characters: run replacements based on single characters and character sets.

tr "first_charcter" "second_character"    ---> used to replace single character

example: head -n 10 <path-to-file>| tr "," " "          ____> replaces all occurences of "," with " " in the first line of the given file

head -n 10 <path-to-file>| tr -d "-"	----> deletes all occurences of "-"

head -n 10 <path-to-file>| tr "[:lower:]" "[:upper:]"	---> replaces all lower case charcters to upper case characters

cut command

Cut out fields from `stdin` or files.


****** EPOCH TIME & UNIX *******

The Unix keeps tracks of the time by counting the number of seconds since a special date in history ( January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC).
There is no special meaning behind the date, it was choosen since it was easy.

date -r 23413312341212 --> will return the corresponding time and date  

The time stamp is represented in signed integers.

Prime numbers play a role in encryption schemes and other cryptographic protocols

Larget signed 32 bit integer 2147483647

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOeWxA9sXFY
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJQ691PTKsA    

minus integers to represent dates back from jan 1 1970

January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC

positive integers to represent dates onwards from jan 1 1970

date +%s   --> displays the time in seconds since epoch

date -r 1233242342  --> displays human readable time 


To kill a process in linux
--------------------------

kill and killall command, two commands that give absolute control over whether an application can continue running or not.

Which command should we use. Almost always use killall. 
Because with killall command, we don't have to worry about finding the PID's of the process.

With killall, we need to know the real name of the process (actuall command and not the name of the application)

To find the actual process name/command, use top command, get the process command, then killall it.

Killall requires the actual command name of the application, that we want to force close, whereas kill requires the process id.

kill -15 "pid"  --> -15 is the option to properly kill a process
kill -9 "pid"   --> -9 is the option to force kill a process

kill -15 $(lsof -i tcp:8080 | awk '$1 == "java" {print $2}')


Kill command kills a process by PID of any process (Process ID)


Killall command kills a process by process name.

PS COMMAND - PROCESS STATUScd

ps -=-=-> to list all running commad in Mac os.

ps aux  --> display a detailed list of all processes running on your system. The columns include the process ID (PID), the user who owns the process, the CPU and memory usage, the command associated with the process, and more

ps -U username --> This command shows all processes owned by a specific user.

ps -p PID ---> Replace "PID" with the actual process ID for which you want to get information. This command shows details for a specific process

DNS Cache: (for fixing 504 Gateway timeout error)

Linux, Windows, Mac save the name resolution information in the form of a DNS cache. 
We can clear our DNS cache.  we Need to flush our cache.

For MAC: sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

sudo dscacheutil -flushcache   --> flushes the DNS cache
sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder --> restarts the process

Using ~ inside double qoutes
----------------------------


#!/bin/zsh

echo "the monkey is flying high"

myfilepath="~/mkbin/myfile.txt"
Wpath="~/mkbin/W"

txt=$(cat "$myfilepath") 
W=$(cat "$Wpath")


echo $txt
echo $W

The above script throwing no such file or directory error.

The issue in your script is related to the tilde (~) expansion when assigning values to myfilepath and Wpath. 
In Unix-like shells, tilde expansion is not performed when the tilde is within double quotes.

You should use the full path or use tilde expansion outside of double quotes. Here's a corrected version of your script:

myfilepath=~/mkbin/myfile.txt
Wpath=~/mkbin/W


linux commands --->

lsblk --> list block devices
It is used ot listt out all vlock deviesin a tree like format.
This powerful command can help you gather comprehensive information about each 
block devices connected to your linux system, including the disk partitions and
their repective sizes.

syntax of the command

lsblk [options] [device...]

lsblk -a (--all)    --> shows all block devices, including the empty ones
lsblk -b (--bytes)  ---> prints the size in bytes instead of in a human
readable format
