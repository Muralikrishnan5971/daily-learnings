Script is a command line program that contains a series of program. 
The command contains in the scripts are executed by an interpreter. Here the shell acts as an interpreter.
Anything you can type in the command line, we can put in the script.

Every script starts with a shebang #!, followed by the path to the shell, which we want to use as a interpreter
eg: #!/bin/bash 
#!/bin/zsh

If the script does not begin with a shebang, the script might still get executed, but it's always good practice to be explicit.

we can even ser python as our interepreter like, #!/bin/python

Variables are storage location that have a name, similar to key-value pair
eg: VARIABLE_NAME="name"

variables, are case sensitive, and by convention variables are uppercase

Valid variable names

FIRST_NAME="firstname"
FIRST3NAME="firstname"
firstName="firstname"

writing tests

syntax: [condition-to-test-for]
example: [ -e /etc/passwd]   --> this checks whether /etc/passwd file exists or not

Every command executed by the shell has a exit code. That exit code is an integer.
Commond that exits with an o exit status has succeeded, A non zero exit status indicates a failure (1-255)
If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it returns a status of 127. 
If a command is found but is not executable, the return status is 126


random is a bilt-in varaible in linux
open terminal, enter echo $RANDOM

which spits random numbers between 0 - 32767, everytime we hit the command, 

Similarly we have a bunch of built-in variables

echo $RANDOM
echo $SHELL
echo $USER
echo $PWD
echo $HOSTNAME

Similarly, we can create our own system variables,

go to terminal, then

name="murali"
echo $name

but we can't use our variable in our script, just yet.

Because the variable name, we just set, cannot be used by a ** child processess **
Yes, our scripts are all child processess.

we change this by the export command

export name       -> Now it can be used by the child processes, meaning all the scripts

But the same thing vanishes, once we EXIT the terminal.

***** to overcome this, we need to set the name="murali" as an environment variable in our .zshrc or .bashrc file  ********
The above step makes our vairable permanant

<__BASH MATH__>

echo $(( 3 +7 ))    --> (()) inside it we write our math function

$(( $RANDOM % 10 ))  --> this gives us a random number from 0 - 9, Similarly

$(( $RANDOM % 20 ))  --> will generate random number between 0 - 19

$(( $RANDOM % 2 ))  --> will generate number between 0 and 1

echo "Do you like to die ? (y/n)"
read ans

#!/bin/zsh
echo "Do you like to die ? (y/n)"
read ans

if [[ $ans == "y" ]]; then
        echo "YOU DIE !!!"
else
        echo "YAY, YOU LIVE !!!"
fi

ALWAYS END YOUR BASH CONDITIONS

Nested IF --> all the conditions must be true

ELIF --> only one condtion is enough to be truev

WHILE LOOP

#!/bin/zsh

x=1

while [[ $x -le 100 ]]
do
        echo "Hey $USER, I did $x push up."
        (( x ++ ))
done

#!/bin/zsh

********************************************************
x=1

while [[ $x -le 100 ]]
do
        # Using read directly to get the value
        read -p "Push up numbner $x: Press to continue"
        # echo "Hey $USER, I did $x push up."
        (( x ++ ))
done


./pushup.sh:read:8: -p: no coprocess

When we source the script we just wrote, its the current SHELL that reads the file, And not the one mentioned in #! shebang line.

To run our script, explicitly mention the interpreter

like bash pushup.sh

While vs Until

While loop will run while something is TRUE
Untill will run untill something is TRUE

FOR LOOPS

for cup in {1..10};
do
        echo "You have had $cup cup of coffee today"
done

*********************************************************

ping -q -c 2 -W 1 googl.com

-q --> make it quiet
-c --> ping count, -c 2 --> piing twice
-W --> wait 



To begin, /dev/null is a special file called the null device in Unix systems. 
Colloquially it is also called the bit-bucket or the blackhole because it immediately discards 
anything written to it and only returns an end-of-file EOF when read.

echo $?
? 

The $? symbol is a special variable that always contains the exit status of the previous command; 
it will be overwritten every time you run a new command. By convention, an exit code of 0 indicates that the previous command was successful while anything greater indicates an error code for that specific program.
