Script is a command line program that contains a series of program. 
The command contains in the scripts are executed by an interpreter. Here the shell acts as an interpreter.
Anything you can type in the command line, we can put in the script.

Every script starts with a shebang #!, followed by the path to the shell, which we want to use as a interpreter
eg: #!/bin/bash 
#!/bin/zsh

If the script does not begin with a shebang, the script might still get executed, but it's always good practice to be explicit.

we can even ser python as our interepreter like, #!/bin/python

Variables are storage location that have a name, similar to key-value pair
eg: VARIABLE_NAME="name"

variables, are case sensitive, and by convention variables are uppercase

Valid variable names

FIRST_NAME="firstname"
FIRST3NAME="firstname"
firstName="firstname"

writing tests

syntax: [condition-to-test-for]
example: [ -e /etc/passwd]   --> this checks whether /etc/passwd file exists or not

Every command executed by the shell has a exit code. That exit code is an integer.
Commond that exits with an o exit status has succeeded, A non zero exit status indicates a failure (1-255)
