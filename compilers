Compilation -> converting source code to machine code

LLVM -> LOW LEVEL VIRTUAL MACHINE.
---------------------------------

LLVM is a compiler and a toolkit for building compilers, which are programs
that convert instructions into a form that can be read and executed by a
computer.

The LLVM project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain
technologies. LLVM helps build new computer languages and improve existing
languages. It automates many of the difficult and unpleasant tasks involved in
language creation, such as porting the outputted code to multiple platforms and
architectures.

LLVM and the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) are both compilers. The difference
is that GCC supports a number of programming languages while LLVM isnâ€™t a
compiler for any given language. LLVM is a framework to generate object code
from any kind of source code.
