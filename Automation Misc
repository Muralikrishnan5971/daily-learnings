To create a xpath for a svg element, we have the syntax as //*[local-name()='svg'].

The local-name function is mandatory for creating a xpath of a svg element. So for the xpath expression for the image highlighted in the above image should be âˆ’

//*[local-name()='svg' and @data-icon='home']/*[local-name()='path']
Here, data-icon is an attribute of the svg tag element which is added accompanied with @ symbol. The [local-name()='path'] is included since it is the child of the svg tagname.
