Docker Commands

docker ps   -> process status
docker ps -s --> shows process status with size


Why we need docker compose
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-docker-compose-how-to-use-it/

Docker Compose is a tool you can use to define and share multi-container applications. 
This means you can run a project with multiple containers using a single source.

For example, assume you're building a project with NodeJS and MongoDB together. 
You can create a single image that starts both containers as a service – you don't need to start each separately.

To achieve this we need to define a docker-compose.yml.
The compose file is a YML file defining services, networks, and volumes for a Docker container. 
There are several versions of the compose file format available – 1, 2, 2.x, and 3.x.





YAML is a digestible data serialization language often used to create configuration files with any programming language. 
Designed for human interaction, YAML is a strict superset of JSON, another data serialization language. 
But because it's a strict superset, it can do everything that JSON can and more.

Major difference between Docker and Virtual Machine,

VM's simulate an entire machine, while containers contain only the application.
Each VM's contain entire os, whereas, contains share the underlying os between them.

VM creates seperate machine with seperate OS's. In docker, all the application resource are bundles into the container.
An Container engine is what unpacks the container files hands them off to the operating system kernel.

Container disadvantage.

Conainers must be packaged to work with the same operating sytem of the server

ie., if the server os is linux, then the container files must linux based and so on.
But thats not the case with VM, as it can run any os at once.

Another disadvantage with container is, since all containers share the server os resources, if the server is crashed,
then all cantainers go down.

Some companies use vm servers and inside the vm's they use containers to extract maximum benifit.
