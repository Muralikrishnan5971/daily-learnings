Funds
-----
1. Equity (share market)
2. Debt (bonds)
3. Balance (hybrid of equity and debt)

All these funds can be actively invested and passively invested
that is, all these funds can be active funds and passive funds.








Types of Mututal funds

Equity Mutual fund

Debt market fund

Active fund
-----------
Active investing is a hands-on approach where the fund manager
is fully involved in the investment process.
The professional buys stocks, sells them, studies the market,
looks for opportunities, and more.


Passive fund
------------
In passive investing, on the other hand, the fund manager has
a negligible role in selecting stocks and market timing as the
scheme seeks to replicate the benchmark returns by investing in
securities in the same proportion as in the index.

things to to be aware of incase of passive funds in expense ratio
tracking error.

EXPENSE RATIO
-------------
Passive mutual fund schemes offer a low-cost option to investors
as the expense ratio is generally lower than active mutual funds.
This is primarily because passive mutual fund schemes do not require
active buying and selling securities like active funds.
They try to imitate the benchmark.

RETURNS
-------
Passive index funds follow a benchmark and deliver returns similar
to the total returns of the securities represented in the benchmark
prior expense ratio and tracking error. However, actively managed
funds can be relatively more volatile. They leverage the knowledge
and experience of the fund manager to generate favourable returns.
They primarily aim to beat the benchmark and may offer higher returns.

Before choosing mutual fund plan, we should know its fund type.
Whether Equity Fund or Debt Fund. Because based on the fund type the taxation
on gains differs.









DEMAT ACCOUNT
-------------
DP - Depository Participant (Ex: Zerodha)
DP ID - Is a identificaiton number for the depository participant (zerodha)
where its demat accounts are maintained. its a 8 digit number same for all its
customers (Zerodha's customers)
BO ID - Benificiery Owner Identification Number

DEMAT ID - Demat Id is 16 digit number combination of DP ID and BO ID
DEMAT ID = DP ID + BO ID

The Demat ID is required when applying for IPO and generating the CDSL TPIN
for holdings authorizations
-------------------------------------------
Using Demat Account we can buy and save Stocks, Bonds, NPS(NET PROMOTER SCORE)
and Mutual Funds.

But in case of Mutual Funds, A Demat Account is not compulsory.
Hence, we can invest in mutual funds in two ways

1. via Demat format
2. via SOA(Statement Of Account)

SOA Format is where we directly go the mutual fund plans website and invest
from there directly. (here there is no involment of the broker, all your
mutual funds is scattered if you invest in different mutual fund plans)

In Demat format, all the mutual fund units will be stored in a de materialised
format.

intentions of taking delivery of actual shares to their demat account. These

the trade date.

price movements.

SPENDING
---------
Know the difference between BEING CHEAP and CONSCIOUS SPENDING

There is power in saying no to the things we don’t care about. But there is
even more power in saying a big YES to the things we love.

Remember, getting a raise is not about you, It's about you demonstrating your
value to your employer

You can’t tell them you need more money because your expenses are higher.
Nobody cares. You can, however, show how your work has been contributing to
the company’s success and ask to be compensated fairly.
Here’s what you need to do:

Three to six months before your review:
Become a top performer by collaboratively setting expectations with your boss,
then exceeding those expectations in every way possible.

One to two months before your review:
Prepare a “briefcase” of evidence to support the exact reasons why you should
be given a raise.

One to two weeks before your review:
Extensively practice the conversation you’ll have with your boss, experimenting
with the right tactics and scripts.

investors.

INDIAN SECURITIES MARKETS
-------------------------
The market in which securities are issued, purchased by investors, and
subsequently transferred among investors is called the securities market.
The securities market has two interdependent and inseparable segments, viz., the
primary market and secondary market.

PRIMARY MARKET
--------------
The primary market is where securities are created. It's in this market that
firms sell (float) new stocks and bonds to the public for the first time. An
initial public offering, or IPO, is an example of a primary market. These
trades provide an opportunity for investors to buy securities from the bank
that did the initial underwriting for a particular stock. An IPO occurs when a
private company issues stock to the public for the first time.

SECONDARY MARKET
---------------
The Secondary market is commonly referred to as STOCK MARKET
Example: NYSE, NSE, BSE, NASDAQ

The defining characteristic of the secondary market is that investors trade
among themselves.
That is, in the secondary market, investors trade previously issued securities
without the issuing companies' involvement. For example, if you go to buy
Amazon (AMZN) stock, you are dealing only with another investor who owns shares
in Amazon. Amazon is not directly involved with the transaction.



CREDIT SCORE
============

CIBIL Score is a 3-digit numeric summary of your credit history, rating and
report, and ranges from 300 to 900. The closer your score is to 900, the better
your credit rating is.

The Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited (CIBIL) is the most popular of
the four credit information companies licensed by Reserve Bank of India.

There are three other companies also licensed by the RBI to function as credit
information companies. They are EXPERIAN, EQUIFAX and HIGHMARK. However, the
most popular credit score in India is the CIBIL score.

CIBIL India is part of TRANSUNION, an American multinational group. Hence
credit scores are known in India as the CIBIL Transunion score.
