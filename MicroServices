 WEB SERVICE - W3C Definition

 A software system designed to support INTEROPERABLE, MACHINE TO MACHINE, INTRACTION OVER A NETWORK. 

 Interoberable meaning - platform independant  

                Request
               ---------------->
              /                 \
 		Application A        Webservice
 			  \                 /
 			   <----------------
 			   Response

 how does the application knows what request to send, where to send it and what is the format for the response ?
 The solution to that is Service Definition. Every webservice offers a Service Definition. 

 A Serice Definition would sepecify the following things. (WADL formats, SWAGGER and etc.  )

 1. Request/Response format
 2. Request structure
 3. Response structure
 4. Endpoint  

 There are two popular way the web service is transported over the network.
 Transport indicates, whether the service is exposed over the queue or over the network
 1. http via url
 2. mq via messeaging queue

 The most important Abstraction in REST is something called a RESOURCE. 
 A resource is anything we'd want to expose to the outside world through our application.

 For example if we take a TO-DO Management App, 
 The users are a resource, What are the to-dos can be resource, A specific to-do is a resource, A list of to-dos is also a resource.
 When we are talking of developing a restful services, we are always talking about resources. What are the resources in my application.

 What we do is, we would assign a URI to the resource.  

 A Resource has an URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)

 /Users/Murali/todo/1
 /Users/Murali/todos
 /Users/Murali

 REST does not worry about how we are representing our resources. Our resources can have different representations
 JSON, XML, HTML
