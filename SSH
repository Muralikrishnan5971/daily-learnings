**ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "muralikrishnan.pro@gmail.com"

this will generate a private and public key file under .ssh folder

**copy the public key and put it in github ssh key section

now we need to add the private key to ssh agent

ssh-add /path to private key

**ssh-add -l

The ssh-add command prompts the user for a private key password and adds it to the list maintained by ssh-agent.
Once you add a password to ssh-agent, you will not be prompted for it when using SSH or scp to connect to hosts with your public key.

**create a config file in .ssh and add the below entries for each account

# Work gitlab account
Host gitlab.com
   HostName gitlab.com
   User git
   PreferredAuthentications publickey
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

when we try to clone any repo using the ssh url eg: git@gitlab.com:muralikrishnan/automation.git

here the user is git, hostname is gitlab, then the corresponding private key will be enabled.
