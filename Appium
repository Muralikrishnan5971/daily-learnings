Appium is cross platform --> Android, IOS, Windows
appium support physical devices, Andriod emulators and IOS emulators as well or similator

Appium uses selenium's Webdriver API,
And Webdriver API uses json wire protocol

Client makes a https request to server, and then the server sends the response back

Appium 2.x no longer supports  json wire protocol, this is completely replaced by W3C webdriver protocol
W3C webdriver protocol is also based on client server architecture

Both Selenium 4.x and Appium 2.x completly removed json wire protocol and fully supports W3C

For every proramming language, we have a appium client

Example,

For Java, we have java cient that converts all java code to restfull api calls to the appium server

Example:

MobileElement el = driver.findElementByAccecibilityId("someId");
el.click();

the above code will be sent as a api call as,

HTTP API: POST /session/:session_id/element/:element_id/click

for every request, the client passes the session id so that server knows 


                                                  /<--UIAutomator2--> android
JAVA CLIENT --{JSON-HTTPS REQUEST}--> APPIUM SERVER 
                                                  \<--XCUITest--> IOS


Appium is a node.js HTTPS server that exposes an API
The client initiates the session using the Desired Capabilities - where we can select the platform, application

** Navtive apps are easy to automate, elements can be identified using appium inspector

** Hybrid apps - contains both Web view and Mobile view (its platform agnostic)
difficult to automate, since there is more of driver context switching and we need to enable debug mode in android app

** Mobile web apps, that are opened in mobile browser. Web apps are responsive versions of websites that can work on any mobile device or OS because theyâ€™re delivered using a mobile browser.

Apart from uiautomatior2 and xcuitest driver, appium supports other derivers as well. There is a ecosystem of drivers.

Ex: youiengine, windows, mac, mac2, espresso, flutter, 

windows driver is nothing but a proxy for winapp which used to automate windows applications

UIAutomator2 -- more suitable for automating functional test cases
Espresso -- more suitable for automating unit test cases

-> node and npm mandatory

npm install -g appium@next

sudo npm install -g appium

--> install appium

appium --version

npm uninstall -g appium

appium driver list

--> installing appium driver

All appium supported driver's are decoupled from the appium server. we need to install them as we need them.

sudo appium driver install uiautomator2

--> install appium inspector
In case if we get apple can't open your software, go to system preferences, general, click open anyway.


set path for sdk manager.

export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/<username>/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator

Now emulator set-up

Open Android studio -> more options -> Virtual Device Manager

Based on the available system resources, we can create multiple AVD's -> Android Virtual Device or Emulators

Start Appium server

Now open Appium inspector and select Appium server.

In the Appium server section we need to give all required information, as Our Appium server needs to know which device it needs to check.

give Remote host, Remote port, Remote path

And then Desired Capabilites details in JSON format in the appim inspector

{
  "automationName": "uiautomator2",
  "platformName": "Android",
  "deviceName": "pixel_3a",
  "app": "/Users/muralikrishnan/Desktop/appium-dummy-app/ApiDemos-debug.apk"
}

get the device name form the properties list, app is the appium's dummy app for automation

So basically we are sending a rest call to the server with the above request body,

So that our appium inspector knows which server to connect to, which driver and which app to install in that device.

Click Start Session

now we cans ee the screenshot and coresponding xml dump in the appium inspector.

also adb devices should list the emulator as the device

adb devices
List of devices attached
emulator-5554   device

this is the udid -> emulator-5554

Same can be used as key value pair as "udid":"emulator-5554" instead of "deviceName": "pixel_3a"

Where we have multiple virtual devices, udid's are helpful
